                </p>
                <h2>Basic steps</h2>
                <p>
                    To use a phone or tablet as a button box, you need to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Define a "page" with buttons in Simpyt's configs</li>
                        <li>Launch Simpyt.pyz in your PC</li>
                        <li>Browse to <strong>http://YOUR_PC_IP_ADDRESS:9999/</strong> from your phone or tablet</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h2>Button pages</h2>
                <p>
                    The button pages are defined as files inside the <strong>simpyt_configs/pages</strong> folder.
                    Each page is a single text file with <strong>.page</strong> extension with some basic settings, 
                    the list of buttons to show, and what they do. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To create or edit them, you can use Notepad or any code editor you like.
                    You can have as many pages as you need and even use them at the same time from different devices.
                    It's time to revive all those old phones :D
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example of a simple page file:
                </p>
                <p>
<pre>
background_image: tomcat_countermeasures_pannel.png
width: 200
height: 130
controls:
- at: 10 50 size 5 5
  action: keys ctrl shift a
- at: 20 50 size 5 5
  action: keys ctrl shift b
</pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                    (in case this looks familiar: yes, it's yaml :D)
                </p>
                <p>
                    That page would show an image of a Tomcat cockpit pannel (which should be added in the 
                    <strong>simpyt_configs/images</strong> folder), with a couple of clickeable buttons that 
                    fire some key presses in your computer when clicked. 
                    You would map those keys to controls in your flight sim, and that's it! A working button 
                    box :)
                </p>
                <h2>Using them from a phone or tablet</h2>
                <p>
                    To show the button box in a phone or tablet, just connect the device to the same wifi network 
                    than your pc and browse to <strong>http://YOUR_PC_IP_ADDRESS:9999/</strong> (don't forget to 
                    run <strong>Simpyt.pyz</strong> in your PC before).
                </p>
                <h2>What else can be done</h2>
                <p>
                    The page and buttons are fully customizable (text, color, borders, images, etc). And when using 
                    a background image with something like a screenshot of an aircraft real pannel, you can make the 
                    simpyt buttons "invisible" and just rely on the background image instead. Simpyt comes with a 
                    demo of an F-16 Viper panel configured this way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Buttons can simulate key presses, joystick button presses, joystick axis movements, open apps, or even 
                    run full scripts of multiple actions.
                </p>

                </p>
                <h2>Basic steps</h2>
                <p>
                    To use a midi controller as a button box, you need to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Define a "midi device" in Simpyt's configs</li>
                        <li>Launch Simpyt.pyz in your PC</li>
                        <li>Use the midi device :)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h2>Midi devices</h2>
                <p>
                    Midi devices are defined as files inside the <strong>simpyt_configs/midis</strong> folder.
                    Each device is a single text file with <strong>.midi_device</strong> extension with some basic settings, 
                    the list of controls to handle, and what they do when used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To create or edit them, you can use Notepad or any code editor you like.
                    You can have as many devices as you need and even use them at the same time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example of a basic midi device file:
                </p>
                <p>
<pre>
name: MY-PIANO-BRAND-XYZ
controls:
- when: note 42 surpasses 64
  action: keys escape
- when: control 40 between 0-127
  action: joystick 1 axis 1
</pre>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thats a simple config that tries to connect to a midi device called "MY-PIANO-BRAND-XYZ" (this should be 
                    the name that the midi device has in your system when plugged in). It fires the escape key when a note is 
                    played in the piano, and simulates a virtual joystick axis when a particular knob is turned.
                </p>
                <h2>What else can be done</h2>
                <p>
                    Different types of midi controls are supported and they can simulate key presses, joystick buttons or axis, 
                    open apps, or even run full scripts of actions.

                <h2>Midi inspector</h2>
                <p>
                    To configure a midi device in Simpyt you will need to know the control and note ids of your device.
                    If you don't know them, we provide you with an extra tool that helps you inspect your device:
                    the Midi Inspector. To use it:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Download the latest release of <a href="https://github.com/fisadev/simpyt/releases">midi_inspector.pyz</a>.</li>
                        <li>Open a terminal (cmd.exe), and run the inspector like this: 
                            <br><code>midi_inspector.pyz "YOUR DEVICE NAME"</code>
                            <br>(the device name can bee seen in Window's Device Manager).</li>
                        <li>Use the controls on your device, and the inspector will print the type, id and value of the controls you are using :)</li>
                    </ul>
